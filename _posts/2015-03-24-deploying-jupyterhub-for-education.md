Over the last few months, I've been busily working on converting a class that I am a TA for from Matlab to Python. Actually, not just Python, but IPython/Jupyter notebooks! Part of this involved setting up a server that the students could log in to in order to complete their assignments. I wrote a post over on the Rackspace developer blog about it:

I've also been busy developing a tool called [nbgrader](http://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader) for grading IPython notebooks. More on this in a future post, hopefully!
