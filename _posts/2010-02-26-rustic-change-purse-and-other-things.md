Here's a pattern that I came up with, for a piece I've titled "Rustic
Change Purse". It's a nice little change purse and is pretty
sturdy. So far I'm very happy with it! I made it over Christmas break
while I snowed in back home in VA because I got tired of all the other
knitting projects I was working on at the time.

26. There are now 9 stitches on your needles. Cut yarn, leaving a long
    enough tail to thread through stitches. Pull tight, and weave in
    ends.
27. You can use any sort of ribbon or string that you like for the
    drawstring, but I cut pieces from each color yarn and braided them
    together for mine. Weave your drawstring in and out through the
    holes at the top of the purse. Tying them together tightens the
    opening.
