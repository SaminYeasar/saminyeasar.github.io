This year, SIPB won the Karl Taylor Compton prize, which is the
highest award that MIT bestows to students or student groups! I and
some other folks went to the awards convocation to receive it from
President Hockfield:

Thanks to all the SIPB members over the years who made this possible:
this was certainly a multi-decade event in the making. From handing
out computer time in the early 70's, to developing [Debathena][2],
[Scripts][3], and [XVM][4] over the last few years, SIPB has worked
hard to help better the state of computing at MIT and everywhere else,
and we will continue to do so in the future!
