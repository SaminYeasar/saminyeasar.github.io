Ok, I'll admit it. I was pretty nervous about going to PyCon. I was
giving a
[talk](http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2655/games-for-science-creating-interactive-psycholog),
I was only going to know a couple of people there, I was going for an
entire week, and it was going to be in a city where they speak a
language of which I only know about two words. Also, I was a bit
unsure of what to expect in terms of the social climate (especially
given that the only other non-academic tech conference I've been to
has been DEFCON, which is not exactly known for being low on sexism).

I shouldn't have worried, though. PyCon was phenomenally awesome! I
met a million amazing people and the talks were exceptionally well
done. Everyone was incredibly friendly and outgoing, so much that I
rarely found time *not* to talk to people! I have to say that PyCon is
easily the best conference I've ever been to (even better than last
year's CogSci, which was also pretty great). Here's a recap.

## Thursday

I flew in on Thursday night, unfortunatly missing the opening
reception. Right off the bat, I met another grad student named
[Olga](https://twitter.com/olgabot), who had been on the same plane as
me and was likewise trying to figure out how to get from the airport
to the conference venue. We ended up sharing a cab with some folks
from Sauce Labs, which was way less stressful than trying to figure
out an unfamiliar transit system in a foreign language with heavy
baggage in tow.  I dropped my stuff off and met up with
[Matthias](https://twitter.com/Mbussonn) for dinner before I went back
to my hotel to collapse.

## Friday

The next morning, I went to the conference and picked up my swag and
badge, then got breakfast with Matthias, where we ran into Greg Wilson
(of Software Carpentry) and Fernando Perez (of IPython). We had a
great discussion about what things aren't emphasized enough when
teaching programming to beginners, and how the IPython Notebook could
be used for class assignments.

I went to
[the keynote by John Perry Barlow](http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2587/keynote-john-perry-barlow),
then wandered around the expo hall a bit, then went to hang out in the
speaker room to work on my talk. I eventually went back to my hotel to
practice my talk a bit more, then went back out to the New Relic
party. I mostly hung out with Matthias, but also got to meet a few
other pythonistas towards the end; I was fairly jetlagged and nervous
about my talk the next morning so was not feeling particularly social.

## Saturday

I got up early to run through my talk once more, then headed back to
the conference to see the keynotes by
[Jessica McKellar](http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2684/keynote-jessica-mckellar)
and
[Fernando Perez](http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2683/keynote-fernando-perez). Jessica's
was alternately sobering and motivating; Fernando's got me excited all
over again (for probably the 100th time) about IPython Notebook,
despite being excited about it to begin with!
[My talk on writing psychology experiments with Panda3D](http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2655/games-for-science-creating-interactive-psycholog)
was then immediately after the keynotes. I am pretty happy with how it
went, and people seemed to really like it! It even caught the
attention of one of the CPython core developers, who tweeted *"Getting
powerful tools into the hands of scientists like @jhamrick is one of
the big reasons I love working on open source"*. Wow, seriously made
my day!

After my talk my brain was pretty fried, but I went to a few other
talks like this awesome one about
[analyzing rap lyrics with Python](http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2658/analyzing-rap-lyrics-with-python)
and
[dealing with imposter syndrome](http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2659/its-dangerous-to-go-alone-battling-the-invisibl)
(which is an issue I still struggle with at times). Later, I spent
some time hanging out at the [plot.ly](https://plot.ly/) expo booth,
and then went to dinner at an awesome
[vegan restaurant called Aux Vivres](https://auxvivres.com/en/) with
some Boston/MIT friends, both old and new!

## Sunday

At breakfast, I hung out some more with Olga. We had an amusing
exchange of realizing that we were familiar with each other online
prior to meeting: she had tweeted my
[post on Python koans](http://www.jesshamrick.com/2014/04/09/python-koans-with-ipython-notebook/)
right before the conference started, and I knew about
[prettyplotlib](http://blog.olgabotvinnik.com/post/58941062205/prettyplotlib-painlessly-create-beautiful-matplotlib),
which she wrote. I always get a kick of out realizing that someone you
met in meatspace is someone you already know (or are familiar with)
online.

The Sunday keynotes were (as the others)
spectacular. [Van Lindberg](http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2688/keynote-van-lindberg)
gave a beautiful and eloquent talk about the importance of diversity
in the PyCon community, and
[Guido Van Rossum](http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2686/keynote-guido-van-rossum-0)
answered audience questions (exclusively from women)
off-the-cuff. After the keynote, I went to the PyLadies' lunch, and a
couple of talks, including
[creating an indie game in Python](http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2663/my-big-gay-adventure-making-releasing-and-selli-0). After
the talks, I went for a bit to the open space for
[500 Lines or Less](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines), which I am
contributing to.

I went to dinner with Matthias, Olga, and a few other people I had
only just met at the conference. After taking entirely too long to
decide where to eat, we found our restaurant of choice was
closed. Eventually, we ended up in an Irish pub and afterwards decided
to go to a [chocolate bar](http://www.julietteetchocolat.com/). As
luck would have it, it started raining just as soon as we left, so we
had a quite fun adventure trying to get to the chocolate bar. Arriving
soaked, we warmed up with crepes and spicy alcoholic chocolate
drinks. Yum! This particular evening was so much fun, and our group
dynamic was great. We alternately had serious discussions about the
world's problems, and silly discussions like where to put IPython
stickers (answer: bottom of Olga's boots).

## Monday and Tuesday

The main conference ended on Sunday, but I stayed the rest of the week
for sprints! Actually, on Monday and Tuesday, I wasn't working on
development sprints -- I was helping to teach a Software Carpentry
bootcamp to librarians with Preston Holmes, Dhavide Aruliah, and Luke
Lee. I was a bit apprehensive about this, as I knew very little about
librarians, but it ended up being quite successful! The class went
from not having touched a command line, to writing a 90-line Python
script by the end of the day on Tuesday that read in a text file
containing "dirty" data, converted the data to a consistent and
reasonable format, and saved it back out. I was so impressed that the
class was able to progress so quickly and produce something with real
applicability.

## Wednesday and Thursday

After the Software Carpentry bootcamp finished, I joined up with the
IPython sprinters. Matthias pointed me towards a few things to work
on, including writing an
[interactive widget for regular expressions](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Carreau/regexmagic/blob/poc-widget/example.ipynb),
adding a
[placeholder feature for text widgets](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/5652),
and
[validating notebook JSON](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/5658). This
has by far been the most I've done for IPython, which is super
exciting for me -- I hope I'll be able to keep the momentum going
forward and continue to contribute to the project!

The last night, I went out to dinner with other folks sprinting on
IPython and scikit-learn, then to a bar where the last few PyCon
stragglers were meeting up with the Montreal Python group. Even on the
last night, when everybody was exhausted and looking forward to going
home, I *still* met new awesome people who were super friendly and
interesting to talk with.

## Go to PyCon!

So, yeah, PyCon was awesome. This recap was basically just the
highlights. There were many instances of having an awesome 10 minute
conversation with somebody, sharing tips with people in the speaker
room, and meeting developers on projects that I really respect and
admire. I really hope I will be able to go again -- I should start
thinking about my talk proposal for next year!

I missed a lot of talks that I wanted to see, especially on Friday
(when I was busy prepping for my talk). Thankfully, they are all
online, so I have a good list of things to watch over the next few
weeks!

Anyway, if you're considering going, even just a little bit: go. It is
so worth it.
