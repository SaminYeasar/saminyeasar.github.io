I am a Senior Research Scientist at [DeepMind][1], where I study how to build
machines that can flexibly build and deploy models of the world. My work
combines insights from cognitive science with structured relational
architectures, model-based deep reinforcement learning, and planning.

I completed my PhD in Psychology at UC Berkeley in Tom Griffiths'
[Computational Cognitive Science Lab][2]. Before that, I researched
intuitive physics in Josh Tenenbaum's
[Computational Cognitive Science Group][3] at MIT.
