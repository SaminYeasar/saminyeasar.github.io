I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at McGill University working with [Dr. Doina Precup][3] at [Mila][1] and [Reasoning and learning lab (rllab)][2]. I'm interested in imitation learning and offline-RL algorithms with the focus of learning lifelong skills in games.

I completed Masters from Electrical and Computer Engineering at McGill University.  My master's research was on "Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning" under the supervision of [Dr. Aditya Mahajan][4] at [Centre for Intelligent Machine (CIM)][5].

I have also worked at [Mila][1] as an intern with [Dr. Doina Precup][3] on NeurIPS MineRL competition 2019, where we explore learning transferable skills over multiple environments from MineCraft gaming environment using imitation learning.

I completed my Under-graduation from Islamic University of Technology (IUT), Bangladesh. I had the pleasure to work on "Computational Nano-photonics" and was supervised by Dr. Md. Ruhul Amin and co-supervised by Dr. Rakibul Hasan Sagor.
