<img src="/images/mass-tower.png" style="float:left; margin: 1em 2em 1.5em 0em;" />

Take a look at the image to the left, and imagine that the gray blocks
are made out of heavy stone, and that the green blocks are made out of
a light plastic. Which direction will this tower fall? How do you
know?

Many people report that they know the answer because they can visually
imagine what it will look like when the tower falls. In other words,
they solve the problem using a type of *mental simulation*, which is
the ability to imagine actions, percepts, and even realities that
exist only in our minds.

There is evidence for mental simulation in almost every area of
cognition: many problems can be solved by visualizing the solution;
athletes can train by mentally simulating motor actions; we can
predict the physical world by imagining how objects interact; and we
can reason through counterfactuals by simulating alternate realities.

I want to understand the computational nature of mental simulation. In
particular, I am interested in questions such as, *why* do we use
mental simulation? That is, what problem does simulation solve, that
other strategies cannot?  How do we decide *when* to use simulation,
rather than an alternative? How do we determine *what* simulations to
run? *How many* simulations should we run, and for *how long*? My
research attempts to answer these questions through a combination of
rational analysis, formal mathematical modeling, and psychophysical
experiments.

For more details, please see my [publications](/publications). I have also given
a somewhat more accessible interview on the [Data
Skeptic podcast](http://dataskeptic.com/epnotes/models-of-mental-simulation.php)
about some of my research.
