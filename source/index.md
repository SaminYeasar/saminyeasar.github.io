I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley in Tom Griffiths'
[Computational Cognitive Science Lab][1]. Previously, I researched
intuitive physics in Josh Tenenbaum's
[Computational Cognitive Science Group][2] at MIT.

My [research](/research) focuses on understanding mental simulation
from a computational perspective. For details, please see my
[publications](/publications).

Additionally, I am a strong advocate for open source, open access, and
open data in science. When I have time, I help out with the occasional
[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) workshop, and
contribute to a number of [open source projects](/software).
