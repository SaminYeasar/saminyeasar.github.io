I am a Psychology PhD student at the University of California Berkeley
in Tom Griffiths'
[Computational Cognitive Science Lab][1]. Previously, I researched
intuitive physics in Josh
Tenenbaum's [Computational Cognitive Science Group][2] at MIT.

My interests lie at the intersection between cognitive science and
artificial intelligence. Broadly, I want to understand how people
integrate perception and reasoning to understand the world around
them. I am particularly interested in computationally specifying the
algorithms underlying reasoning, as well as the knowledge
representations accessed by those algorithms, by drawing on methods
from machine learning and statistics. I have most recently focused on
how people reason about every day physical events, modeling this
"intuitive physics" through knowledge-rich simulations consistent with
Newtonian physics.
