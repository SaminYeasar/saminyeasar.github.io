I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley in Tom Griffiths'
[Computational Cognitive Science Lab][1]. Previously, I researched
intuitive physics in Josh Tenenbaum's
[Computational Cognitive Science Group][2] at MIT.

I study human cognition by combining probabilistic models from machine learning
with behavioral experiments from cognitive science. My [research](/research)
focuses specifically on understanding mental simulation from a computational,
resource-rational perspective. For details, please see my
[publications](/publications).

Additionally, I am a strong advocate for open source, open access, and open data
in science. I am a core contributor to the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
project and lead maintainer of
[nbgrader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader#nbgrader), which is a tool for
creating and grading assignments in the Jupyter notebook. When I have time, I
help out with the occasional [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)
workshop and contribute to a number of other [open source projects](/software).
