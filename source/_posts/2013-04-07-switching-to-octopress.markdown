As you may be able to tell, the look of this site has drastically
changed. I've been meaning to overhaul the theme for a while, and I
decided I also wanted to try something different from Wordpress. In
particular, I wanted more flexibility with embedding code, which
Octopress seems to be [particularly good
at](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/code/): 

```python Hello, World!
def hello_world():
    print "Hello, World!"

hello_world()
```

Also, I just really like how Octopress blogs look by default. I've
been fiddling with the theme on this today, and I'll probably continue
to fiddle with it going forward. Because Octopress serves static
content, I feel like I have somewhat more control over the look and
feel of my blog -- and importantly, I can try out changes locally
before deploying them, which was not something I could do with
Wordpress.

Hurray for change and learning new tools!
