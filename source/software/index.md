A full list of projects that I have contributed to or maintain is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jhamrick?tab=repositories).

I am currently a member of the [Jupyter Steering Council](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPEP-29:-Project-Governance) and I also contribute to the following open source projects:

* [nbgrader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader) (primary maintainer), a tool built on top
  of IPython to help instructors create and grade assignments in the
  IPython notebook.
* [Jupyter/IPython](http://jupyter.org/), an architecture for interactive
  computing.
* [psiTurk](http://psiturk.org/), a platform for running psychological
  experiments on Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
* [datapackage](https://github.com/tryggvib/datapackage), a Python
  library for interacting with
  [data packages](http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/).
* [scenesim](http://web.mit.edu/~pbatt/www/scenesim-doc/), a Python
  library for simulating and rendering physical scenes.

I also maintain several personal open source projects:

* [bayesian_quadrature](http://jhamrick.github.io/bayesian-quadrature/),
  a Python library for using Bayesian quadrature methods.
* [gaussian_processes](http://jhamrick.github.io/gaussian_processes/), a
  Python library for using Gaussian processes. While other Python
  implementations of Gaussian processes exist, this library is
  specifically designed to expose the underlying math (e.g.,
  log-likelihoods, derivatives of the log-likelihood, etc.).
* [dbtools](http://jhamrick.github.io/dbtools/), a Python library that
  provides a simple interface to SQLite databases.

Many people also seem to find my
[emacs configuration](https://github.com/jhamrick/emacs) helpful.
